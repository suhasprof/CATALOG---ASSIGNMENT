 FORMULA  UTILIZED -> Lagrange Interpolation.

APPROACH (LANG : CPP)
1)Input Parsing (JSON Format):
The input data (roots and their corresponding y-values) is provided in a JSON format.
is given with a y-value in a specific base (e.g., base 10, base 16, base 2, etc.). The program first decodes these y-values into their corresponding decimal representations.

2)Decoding Base Values:
The program decodes the y-values based on their provided base by using stoi() or stol() functions with the base information. This transforms the encoded strings into integers that can be used for interpolation.
3) Lagrange interpolation, computation and obatining constant.
