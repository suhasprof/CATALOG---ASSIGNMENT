Lagrange Interpolation:
Lagrange interpolation is a powerful method for reconstructing polynomials based on known points. It doesn’t require solving linear systems, making it a direct approach for small datasets.

Decoded Roots and Polynomial Solutions:
In this problem, the roots of the polynomial are encoded in various number systems (binary, hexadecimal, etc.). Decoding these values was a crucial step before applying any polynomial solving technique.

Practical Problem Solving:
You’ve explored how real-world data, often encoded in different formats or systems, can be decoded and used to construct meaningful solutions such as polynomials. This is directly applicable in areas like cryptography, where secrets can be hidden in multiple layers of encoding.

Algebra and Numerical Methods:
The problem highlights the importance of algebraic techniques and numerical methods (like Gaussian elimination, Lagrange interpolation) for solving real-world problems where exact solutions are required.
